# Secure Diary
This desktop application, developed using Qt Creator with C++, is designed for goal tracking and daily progress logging. It features SHA256 hash password security, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. The application includes a password authentication window, a password change window, a main logging interface, and a custom messages window. This project not only serves as a practical tool for personal use but also exemplifies my proficiency in C++ and Qt development, making it a key addition to my professional portfolio.
